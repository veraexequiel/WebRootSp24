            <p class="elevator-pitch">Hi, my name is Exe. I'm a graduating Software Development student at Bellevue College, originally from Argentina. I'm passionate about technology and programming, with a love for animals, especially raccoons. Outside of academics, I enjoy snowboarding, longboarding, and attending music festivals. I also have a deep appreciation for the outdoors, whether it's hiking, going to the beach, or playing sports. <a href="html/sensorResearch.html">Sensor Research</a></p>
